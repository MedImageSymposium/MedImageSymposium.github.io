MISP², the Medical Imaging Symposium, is an annual symposium for Netherlands-based PhD students and postdoctoral researchers in medical imaging. The event serves as a platform for networking and sharing your research, fostering collaboration and knowledge exchange in the medical imaging field. It also gives an opportunity to young researchers to share their work and practice presentation skills. You are welcome to present any work, whether it's new or something you've previously done, published, or presented. Our primary aim is to foster collaborations inside the Netherlands.
