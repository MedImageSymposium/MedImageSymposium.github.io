MISP², the Medical Imaging Symposium, is an annual symposium for Netherlands-based PhD students and postdoctoral researchers in medical imaging. The event serves as a platform for networking and sharing your research, fostering collaboration and knowledge exchange in the medical imaging field. It also gives an opportunity to young researchers to share their work and practice presentation skills. You are welcome to present any work, whether it's new or something you've previously done, published, or presented. Our primary aim is to foster collaborations inside the Netherlands.

## Organization

MISP² 2026 is hosted by [LKEB](https://www.lumc.nl/en/afdelingen/radiologie/division-of-image-processing-lkeb/) at the LUMC Leiden and organized by Jenia Makarevich, Dr. Alexander Vieth, Dr. Efe Ilicak, Baris Imre and Chinmay Rao.

<b>Chinmay Rao</b> is a PhD candidate at LKEB working on multi-contrast MRI reconstruction and synthesis. His work aims at shortening MR exam times by leveraging redundancies across the various MR contrasts, using representation learning techniques to model the shared underlying anatomical structure and applying it in the reconstruction of images from highly undersampled raw data.  

Chinmay has a background in electronics engineering (BTech, Karunya Institute of Technology, India) and artificial intelligence (MSc, Maastricht University, The Netherlands) with focus on signal processing, generative modeling, representation learning, and (medical) imaging systems. 
In his spare time, Chinmay enjoys cycling, reading hard sci-fi and philosophy, and working on art projects.

<b>Baris Imre</b> is a PhD candidate in the Division of Image Processing (LKEB). He focuses on low-field MRI imaging, developing various AI based methods that aim to make these images clinically relevant. His most recent works involve diffusion-based methods to reconstruct under-sampled low-filed scans.   

Baris has earned his BSc and MSc degrees from the University of Twente in computer science. After that he worked as a junior researcher at the Mathematics of Imaging and AI group prior to joining LKEB. 

<b>Dr. Efe Ilicak</b> is a postdoctoral researcher specializing in medical imaging, with a focus on AI-based image reconstruction for portable MRI systems. His research aims to improve access to high-quality diagnostic imaging by integrating AI with cost-effective hardware. Before joining LUMC, Efe completed his BSc and MSc in Electrical and Electronics Engineering at Bilkent University, and earned his PhD in Medical Physics from Heidelberg University. 

<b>Dr. Alexander Vieth</b> is a postdoctoral researcher in the Imaging Genetics group at LKEB. His current work focusses on improving tools for exploration and analysis of single-cell and spatial transcriptomics data. Alexander obtained his PhD from the Delft University of Technology specializing in Visual Analytics for exploring high-dimensional images with dimensionality reduction methods. 

<b>Jenia Makarevich</b> is a PhD candidate in the Division of Image Processing (LKEB). Her research focuses on predicting tumour growth and developing models for future tumour volume estimation of vestibular schwannoma. By analysing longitudinal MRI data, she aims to characterise individual tumour dynamics over time. The final goal of her work is to create a tool that enables clinicians to optimize follow-up imaging schedules based on predicted tumour progression. 

Jenia earned her MSc in Artificial Intelligence for Health from Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam in 2024 and her BSc in Econometrics from Belarusian State University.
Beyond her research, Jenia serves as Treasurer on the board of the LUMC Association of PhD Candidates (https://www.laplumc.org/), where she also enjoys organizing community and academic events. In her free time, she enjoys open water swimming and knitting.
