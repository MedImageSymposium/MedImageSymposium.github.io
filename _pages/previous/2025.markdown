After a successful return of MISP² in 2024, we continue the event in 2025 at the University of Twente! MISP² is an annual symposium for Netherlands-based PhD students and postdoctoral researchers in medical imaging. The event serves as a platform for networking and sharing your research, fostering collaboration and knowledge exchange in the medical imaging field.\
\
The Medical Imaging Symposium for PhDs and Postdocs will take place on Wednesday 15 January 2025 in the [TechMed Center](https://www.utwente.nl/en/techmed/) of the University of Twente.
