<div style="width: 73%; float: left;">
<p>
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/willem-grootjans-1b02b449/">Willem Grootjans</a> is an assistant professor and technical physician at the Department of Radiology at LUMC. He graduated cum laude in Technical Medicine (Robotics & Imaging) at the University of Twente, completed his PhD at Radboud UMC on PET imaging for personalized lung-cancer management, and continued his postdoctoral work in advanced oncologic imaging at LUMC. In 2018, he founded the Imaging Services Group (ISG), a specialized unit delivering high-quality, AI-enhanced image processing for routine radiological reporting. Since 2019, he has led the ISG, driving innovation across clinical workflows and implementing technologies that meaningfully support healthcare professionals while keeping patient needs at the center.

Radiology faces rising demand, increasing workload, and growing complexity. While AI tools for detection, triage, and workflow optimization are rapidly emerging, real-world implementation remains the true challenge. <br>
In his keynote, Willem will discuss: <br>
- How AI can be integrated into real clinical workflows <br>
- What technical infrastructure is required <br>
- Examples of AI tools already deployed in practice, such as automated chest X-ray reporting system <br>
- How clinicians and IT teams can collaborate to make AI adoption successful and sustainable 


### Keynote II: Prerak Mody & Pieter Kitslaar (Medis)

Pieter and Prerak will share the history of Medis and its journey to release AI-enabled image-processing software for cardiac MR, CT, US, and X-ray scans used by clinics worldwide. Deploying AI applications in clinical settings is a multi-faceted challenge, and they highlight why data, not just models, often determines success or failure in clinical AI. <br>
The talk will cover practical, research-relevant insights, including: <br>
- How to obtain quality-controlled annotated data. <br>
- What tools to use to predict dataset requirements. <br>
- How to maintain an increasing number of AI models in real-world applications. <br>
