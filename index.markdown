MISP, traditionally an annual symposium for Netherlands-based PhD students in medical imaging, is making a comeback. Interrupted by lockdowns, it returns as MISPÂ², now also including postdoctoral researchers. This event serves as a platform for networking and sharing your research, fostering collaboration and knowledge exchange in the medical imaging field.

The Medical Imaging Symposium for PhDs and Postdocs will take place on Wednesday 17 January 2024 in the Piet Borst Auditorium at the [Netherlands Cancer Institute][nki]. More information is soon to follow!
