        <p><b>Keynote 1: Dr. Efstratios Gavves</b> is an Associate Professor at the University of Amsterdam, Lecturer of Deep Learning at the MSc in AI, Scholar ELLIS European Network of Excellent in AI, and co-founder of Ellogon.AI. His core scientific hypothesis, and research focus, is the computational understanding of time, dynamics, and causality, which believes to be fundamental for AI that generalizes and extrapolates to open, embodied, interactive “visual data worlds”. On this, he pioneered dynamical video representations in visual spatiotemporal data in 2014, while in 2016, he introduced the paradigm-shifting Siamese algorithms in visual object tracking, challenging 30 years of practice, now adopted by virtually all state-of-the-art. Since 2021 he has been spearheading research on Causal Representation Learning for algorithms that learn completely autonomously by integrating cause-and-effect in their core. To research the computational learning of time, he was awarded the ERC Career Starting Grant 2020, the NWO VIDI, and became director of the QUVA Deep Vision Lab with Qualcomm, and the POP-AART Lab with the Netherlands Cancer Institute and Elekta. Efstratios currently supervises a team of 15 doctoral students, on theory and applications of Deep Learning and Dynamics, and Computer Vision. He has also been advancing AI algorithms for identifying cancer patients that benefit from immunotherapy.
